# Auditing-Linux
Script for auditing Linux systems (in particular Red Hats) in C, Ansi-style, that incorporate a MySQL schema with controls & testings. The design of controls were performed in basis to "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Security Technical Implementation Guide" (https://www.stigviewer.com/stig/red_hat_enterprise_linux_7/).

Among others, the program incorporates remote SSH2 login for querying and running the script/commands, and a full MySQL schema for reading/storing controls & procedures<sup>1</sup>.

If you are interested in delving into this, or in other systems/platforms (Cybersecurity, Oracle, MySQL, SAP HANA, AIX, among others), pls, contact me! (luis.alfie@gmail.com)

<sup><sup>1</sup> Incoporating more than 250 controls (Low, Medium, and High grading).</sup>
