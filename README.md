# Auditing-Linux-Minimal
***(Under development)*** Script for auditing Linux systems (in particular Red Hats) in C, Ansi-style, that incorporate a MySQL schema with controls & testings. The design of controls were performed in basis to "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Security Technical Implementation Guide" (https://www.stigviewer.com/stig/red_hat_enterprise_linux_7/).

This is a minimal/example version that provided only the MySQL schema with "Low" grading findings. For in-deep version, as well, for others systems/plattforms (Cybersecurity, Oracle, MySQL, SAP HANA, among others), pls, contact me! (luis.alfie@gmail.com)

The following image correspond to a full version of the program, that incorporates, among others, remote SSH2 login for querying and running the script/commands, and a full MySQL schema for reading/storing controls & procedures<sup>1</sup>.

<sup><sup>1</sup> Incoporating more than 250 controls (Low, Medium, and High grading).</sup>
